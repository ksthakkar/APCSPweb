        <h1>1.1.9 Project</h1>
        <img src="images/119proj.PNG">
        <p>Our 1.1.9 project is called Maze Runner. The game randomly generates squares/gates that the player has to go through and reach the end to score points. We used 'turtle' to create the grid system along with for loops and while loop, and the movement procedures (made with screen.listen()). 
            The player coordinates are updated every 0.1 seconds so that collsions can be detected effectively. </p>

        <h1>1.2.5 Project</h1>
        <img src="images/cardMatching.PNG" width="800" height="600">
        <p> Our 1.2.5 project is Card Matching. We created a 4x4 grid of cards with their corresponding buttons next to them on the right. The game works by clicking on the white buttons to open
            the cards. It plays an animation to "open the card." Then if two cards have the same image, 5 points are added to the score. Once all cards are matched, the game ends</p>

        <p>This game is a remake of Jetpack Joyride made on Scratch. Press Space to start the game. Hold/Tap Space to move the minion up and down. 
           Dodge the red lasers and collect as many bananas as you can! It uses procedures, user input(space), sounds(background music), animations (red lasers), 
           change of costumes (minion turns red), scoring and events.</p>

        <p>We concluded that the robot is on the desert plains biome. We were able to sort the continuous data given to us. We sorted our data into 4 graphs in order
        to represent sound, movement, light, and temperature and then graphed our data in google spreadsheets. 
            
        We picked the desert plains because the temperature starts low and rises high and plateaus at a certain point. We can see the quick exponential increase of the temperature as stated in the desert plain conditions. The movement is something that can go under 0 because of the wind. This is most likely the orentation of the robot 
            which can be negative or positive. The sound is constant with breaks. This shows the constant chirping of the alien animals that vary in sound.
            and the light is also bright and constant (with some variances because of the clouds and time of day). Overall, we thought the desert plains was the robot's location..</p>

        <h1>3.2.4 </h1>
        <img src="images/314graphs.PNG" width="1300" height="600">
        <p> Our graphs display the total honey production over time. In these graphs we seperate the data into large honey producers, medium producers and low producers. Our legend show the states that are in each group.
            The production value in 1997 was much higher because the total bee population was higher. In 2002 and onwards, each state tried to keep their production levels relatively the same. We chose to use subplots to plot all three 
            on the same page. (3 columns in 1 row).
